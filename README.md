# Pomodoro Timer

From wikipedia:
>The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Our timer has 25 work windows, with 5 minutes breaks in between and, after 4 sessions of work, a long break of 20 minutes.
